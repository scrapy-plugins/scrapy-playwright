A Scrapy Download Handler which performs requests using
[Playwright for Python](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python).
It can be used to handle pages that require JavaScript (among other things),
while adhering to the regular Scrapy workflow (i.e. without interfering
with request scheduling, item processing, etc).


## Requirements

After the release of [version 2.0](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/news.html#scrapy-2-0-0-2020-03-03),
which includes [coroutine syntax support](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/2.0/topics/coroutines.html)
and [asyncio support](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/2.0/topics/asyncio.html), Scrapy allows
to integrate `asyncio`-based projects such as `Playwright`.


### Minimum required versions

* Python >= 3.7
* Scrapy >= 2.0 (!= 2.4.0)
* Playwright >= 1.8.0a1


## Installation

```
$ pip install scrapy-playwright
```

## Changelog

Please see the [changelog.md](changelog.md) file.


## Configuration

Replace the default `http` and `https` Download Handlers through
[`DOWNLOAD_HANDLERS`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html):

```python
DOWNLOAD_HANDLERS = {
    "http": "scrapy_playwright.handler.ScrapyPlaywrightDownloadHandler",
    "https": "scrapy_playwright.handler.ScrapyPlaywrightDownloadHandler",
}
```

Note that the `ScrapyPlaywrightDownloadHandler` class inherits from the default
`http/https` handler. Unless explicitly marked (see the "Basic usage"),
requests will be processed by the regular Scrapy download handler.

Also, be sure to [install the `asyncio`-based Twisted reactor](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/asyncio.html#installing-the-asyncio-reactor):

```python
TWISTED_REACTOR = "twisted.internet.asyncioreactor.AsyncioSelectorReactor"
```

### Settings

`scrapy-playwright` accepts the following settings:

* `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSER_TYPE` (type `str`, default `chromium`)
    The browser type to be launched. Valid values are (`chromium`, `firefox`, `webkit`).

* `PLAYWRIGHT_LAUNCH_OPTIONS` (type `dict`, default `{}`)

    A dictionary with options to be passed when launching the Browser.
    See the docs for [`BrowserType.launch`](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-browsertype#browser_typelaunchkwargs).

* `PLAYWRIGHT_CONTEXTS` (type `dict[str, dict]`, default `{}`)

    A dictionary which defines Browser contexts to be created on startup.
    It should be a mapping of (name, keyword arguments) For instance:
    ```python
    {
        "first": {
            "context_arg1": "value",
            "context_arg2": "value",
        },
        "second": {
            "context_arg1": "value",
        },
    }
    ```
    If no contexts are defined, a default context (called `default`) is created.
    The arguments passed here take precedence over the ones defined in `PLAYWRIGHT_CONTEXT_ARGS`.
    See the docs for [`Browser.new_context`](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-browser#browsernew_contextkwargs).

* `PLAYWRIGHT_DEFAULT_NAVIGATION_TIMEOUT` (type `Optional[float]`, default `None`)

    The timeout used when requesting pages by Playwright. If `None` or unset,
    the default value will be used (30000 ms at the time of writing this).
    See the docs for [BrowserContext.set_default_navigation_timeout](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-browsercontext#browser_contextset_default_navigation_timeouttimeout).

* `PLAYWRIGHT_PROCESS_REQUEST_HEADERS` (type `Union[Callable, str]`, default `scrapy_playwright.headers.use_scrapy_headers`)

    The path to a coroutine function (`async def`) that processes headers for a given request
    and returns a dictionary with the headers to be used (note that, depending on the browser,
    additional default headers will be sent as well).

    The function must return a `dict` object, and receives the following keyword arguments:

    ```python
    - browser_type: str
    - playwright_request: playwright.async_api.Request
    - scrapy_headers: scrapy.http.headers.Headers
    ```

    The default value (`scrapy_playwright.headers.use_scrapy_headers`) tries to emulate Scrapy's
    behaviour for navigation requests, i.e. overriding headers with their values from the Scrapy request.
    For non-navigation requests (e.g. images, stylesheets, scripts, etc), only the `User-Agent` header
    is overriden, for consistency.

    There is another function available: `scrapy_playwright.headers.use_playwright_headers`,
    which will return the headers from the Playwright request without any changes.

* `PLAYWRIGHT_MAX_PAGES_PER_CONTEXT` (type `int`, defaults to the value of Scrapy's `CONCURRENT_REQUESTS` setting)

    Maximum amount of allowed concurrent Playwright pages for each context.
    See the [notes about leaving unclosed pages](#receiving-the-page-object-in-the-callback).

* `PLAYWRIGHT_ABORT_REQUEST` (type `Optional[Union[Callable, str]]`, default `None`)

    A predicate function (or the path to a function) that receives a
    `playwright.async_api.Request` object and must return `True` if the
    request should be aborted, `False` otherwise.

    For instance, the following prevents the download of images:
    ```python
    PLAYWRIGHT_ABORT_REQUEST = lambda req: req.resource_type == "image"
    ```

    Note that all requests will appear in the DEBUG level logs, however there will
    be no corresponding response log lines for aborted requests. Aborted requests
    are counted in the `playwright/request_count/aborted` job stats item.


## Basic usage

Set the `playwright` [Request.meta](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/request-response.html#scrapy.http.Request.meta)
key to download a request using Playwright:

```python
import scrapy

class AwesomeSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = "awesome"

    def start_requests(self):
        # GET request
        yield scrapy.Request("https://httpbin.org/get", meta={"playwright": True})
        # POST request
        yield scrapy.FormRequest(
            url="https://httpbin.org/post",
            formdata={"foo": "bar"},
            meta={"playwright": True},
        )

    def parse(self, response):
        # 'response' contains the page as seen by the browser
        yield {"url": response.url}
```

### Notes about the User-Agent header

By default, outgoing requests include the `User-Agent` set by Scrapy (either with the
`USER_AGENT` or `DEFAULT_REQUEST_HEADERS` settings or via the `Request.headers` attribute).
This could cause some sites to react in unexpected ways, for instance if the user agent
does not match the running Browser. If you prefer the `User-Agent` sent by
default by the specific browser you're using, set the Scrapy user agent to `None`.


## Receiving the Page object in the callback

Specifying a non-False value for the `playwright_include_page` `meta` key for a
request will result in the corresponding `playwright.async_api.Page` object
being available in the `playwright_page` meta key in the request callback.
In order to be able to `await` coroutines on the provided `Page` object,
the callback needs to be defined as a coroutine function (`async def`).

```python
import scrapy

class AwesomeSpiderWithPage(scrapy.Spider):
    name = "page"

    def start_requests(self):
        yield scrapy.Request(
            url="https://example.org",
            meta={"playwright": True, "playwright_include_page": True},
            errback=self.errback,
        )

    async def parse(self, response):
        page = response.meta["playwright_page"]
        title = await page.title()  # "Example Domain"
        await page.close()
        return {"title": title}

    async def errback(self, failure):
        page = failure.request.meta["playwright_page"]
        await page.close()
```

**Notes:**

* In order to avoid memory issues, it is recommended to manually close the page
  by awaiting the `Page.close` coroutine.
* Be careful about leaving pages unclosed, as they count towards the limit set by
  `PLAYWRIGHT_MAX_PAGES_PER_CONTEXT`. It's recommended to set a Request errback to
  make sure pages are closed even if a request fails.
* Any network operations resulting from awaiting a coroutine on a `Page` object
  (`goto`, `go_back`, etc) will be executed directly by Playwright, bypassing the
  Scrapy request workflow (Scheduler, Middlewares, etc).


## Proxy support

Proxies are supported at the Browser level by specifying the `proxy` key in
the `PLAYWRIGHT_LAUNCH_OPTIONS` setting:

```python
PLAYWRIGHT_LAUNCH_OPTIONS = {
    "proxy": {
        "server": "http://myproxy.com:3128",
        "username": "user",
        "password": "pass",
    },
}
```

You can also set proxies per context with the `PLAYWRIGHT_CONTEXTS` setting:

```python
PLAYWRIGHT_CONTEXTS = {
    "default": {
        "proxy": {
            "server": "http://default-proxy.com:3128",
            "username": "user1",
            "password": "pass1",
        },
    },
    "alternative": {
        "proxy": {
            "server": "http://alternative-proxy.com:3128",
            "username": "user2",
            "password": "pass2",
        },
    },
}
```

See also the [upstream Playwright section](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/network#http-proxy)
on HTTP Proxies.

## Multiple browser contexts

Multiple [browser contexts](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/core-concepts/#browser-contexts)
to be launched at startup can be defined via the `PLAYWRIGHT_CONTEXTS` [setting](#settings).

### Choosing a specific context for a request

Pass the name of the desired context in the `playwright_context` meta key:

```python
yield scrapy.Request(
    url="https://example.org",
    meta={"playwright": True, "playwright_context": "first"},
)
```

### Creating a context during a crawl

If the context specified in the `playwright_context` meta key does not exist, it will be created.
You can specify keyword arguments to be passed to
[`Browser.new_context`](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-browser#browsernew_contextkwargs)
in the `playwright_context_kwargs` meta key:

```python
yield scrapy.Request(
    url="https://example.org",
    meta={
        "playwright": True,
        "playwright_context": "new",
        "playwright_context_kwargs": {
            "java_script_enabled": False,
            "ignore_https_errors": True,
            "proxy": {
                "server": "http://myproxy.com:3128",
                "username": "user",
                "password": "pass",
            },
        },
    },
)
```

Please note that if a context with the specified name already exists,
that context is used and `playwright_context_kwargs` are ignored.

### Closing a context during a crawl

After [receiving the Page object in your callback](#receiving-the-page-object-in-the-callback),
you can access a context though the corresponding [`Page.context`](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-page#page-context)
attribute, and await [`close`](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-browsercontext#browser-context-close) on it.

```python
def parse(self, response):
    yield scrapy.Request(
        url="https://example.org",
        callback=self.parse_in_new_context,
        meta={"playwright": True, "playwright_context": "new", "playwright_include_page": True},
    )

async def parse_in_new_context(self, response):
    page = response.meta["playwright_page"]
    title = await page.title()
    await page.context.close()  # close the context
    await page.close()
    return {"title": title}
```


## Executing actions on pages

A sorted iterable (`list`, `tuple` or `dict`, for instance) could be passed
in the `playwright_page_methods`
[Request.meta](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/request-response.html#scrapy.http.Request.meta)
key to request coroutines to be awaited on the `Page` before returning the final
`Response` to the callback.

This is useful when you need to perform certain actions on a page, like scrolling
down or clicking links, and you want to handle only the final result in your callback.

### `PageMethod` class

#### `scrapy_playwright.page.PageMethod(method: str, *args, **kwargs)`:

Represents a method to be called (and awaited if necessary) on a
`playwright.page.Page` object, such as "click", "screenshot", "evaluate", etc.
`method` is the name of the method, `*args` and `**kwargs`
are passed when calling such method. The return value
will be stored in the `PageMethod.result` attribute.

For instance,
```python
def start_requests(self):
    yield Request(
        url="https://example.org",
        meta={
            "playwright": True,
            "playwright_page_methods": [
                PageMethod("screenshot", path="example.png", fullPage=True),
            ],
        },
    )

def parse(self, response):
    screenshot = response.meta["playwright_page_methods"][0]
    # screenshot.result contains the image's bytes
```

produces the same effect as:
```python
def start_requests(self):
    yield Request(
        url="https://example.org",
        meta={"playwright": True, "playwright_include_page": True},
    )

async def parse(self, response):
    page = response.meta["playwright_page"]
    await page.screenshot(path="example.png", full_page=True)
    await page.close()
```


### Supported methods

Please refer to the [upstream docs for the `Page` class](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-page)
to see available methods.

### Impact on Response objects

Certain `Response` attributes (e.g. `url`, `ip_address`) reflect the state after the last
action performed on a page. If you issue a `PageMethod` with an action that results in
a navigation (e.g. a `click` on a link), the `Response.url` attribute will point to the
new URL, which might be different from the request's URL.


## Page events

A dictionary of Page event handlers can be specified in the `playwright_page_event_handlers`
[Request.meta](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/request-response.html#scrapy.http.Request.meta) key.
Keys are the name of the event to be handled (`dialog`, `download`, etc).
Values can be either callables or strings (in which case a spider method with the name will be looked up).

Example:

```python
from playwright.async_api import Dialog

async def handle_dialog(dialog: Dialog) -> None:
    logging.info(f"Handled dialog with message: {dialog.message}")
    await dialog.dismiss()

class EventSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = "event"

    def start_requests(self):
        yield scrapy.Request(
            url="https://example.org",
            meta=dict(
                playwright=True,
                playwright_page_event_handlers={
                    "dialog": handle_dialog,
                    "response": "handle_response",
                },
            ),
        )

    async def handle_response(self, response: PlaywrightResponse) -> None:
        logging.info(f"Received response with URL {response.url}")
```

See the [upstream `Page` docs](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-page/) for a list of
the accepted events and the arguments passed to their handlers.

**Note**: keep in mind that, unless they are
[removed later](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/events/#addingremoving-event-listener),
these handlers will remain attached to the page and will be called for subsequent
downloads using the same page. This is usually not a problem, since by default
requests are performed in single-use pages.


## Examples

**Click on a link, save the resulting page as PDF**

```python
class ClickAndSavePdfSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = "pdf"

    def start_requests(self):
        yield scrapy.Request(
            url="https://example.org",
            meta=dict(
                playwright=True,
                playwright_page_methods={
                    "click": PageMethod("click", selector="a"),
                    "pdf": PageMethod("pdf", path="/tmp/file.pdf"),
                },
            ),
        )

    def parse(self, response):
        pdf_bytes = response.meta["playwright_page_methods"]["pdf"].result
        with open("iana.pdf", "wb") as fp:
            fp.write(pdf_bytes)
        yield {"url": response.url}  # response.url is "https://www.iana.org/domains/reserved"
```

**Scroll down on an infinite scroll page, take a screenshot of the full page**

```python
class ScrollSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = "scroll"

    def start_requests(self):
        yield scrapy.Request(
            url="http://quotes.toscrape.com/scroll",
            meta=dict(
                playwright=True,
                playwright_include_page=True,
                playwright_page_methods=[
                    PageMethod("wait_for_selector", "div.quote"),
                    PageMethod("evaluate", "window.scrollBy(0, document.body.scrollHeight)"),
                    PageMethod("wait_for_selector", "div.quote:nth-child(11)"),  # 10 per page
                ],
            ),
        )

    async def parse(self, response):
        page = response.meta["playwright_page"]
        await page.screenshot(path="quotes.png", fullPage=True)
        await page.close()
        return {"quote_count": len(response.css("div.quote"))}  # quotes from several pages
```
